# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Tuvok. We think it can be a useful, widely-applicable tool for folks writing Terraform and looking for additional validation of linting rules or coding standards. Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Tuvok itself. Please, don't use the issue tracker for Rackspace support questions.

# Ground Rules

* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

# Getting started

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through labels like beginner and help-wanted on issues:
* Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# How to report a bug

When filing an issue, make sure to tell us what versions of Python and Terraform you're using, what you did, what you expected to see, and what you saw instead.

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email [security@rackspace.com](mailto:security@rackspace.com) instead. See our [Rackspace Security Vulnerability Reporting](https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/rsdp) page for more information.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

Our goal is to provide a standards validation and linting tool for recent versions of Terraform. We intend to ship rules that are broadly applicable inside and outside of Rackspace. If you have suggestions for features, enhancements, or rules, please open an issue and describe your use case, how it fits into these goals, and it's applicability inside and outside of Rackspace.

# Code review process

The team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly meeting. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
